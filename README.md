##  üìùDescription
Website which achieves Robust human target detection and acquisition/locking without losing track under occlusions for outdoor operational scenarios. It also includes a dashboard which reflects the number of suspicious activities detected and chatbot assistance as well.

## üîÆFuture Scope
Future plans for the project :
- Buzzer alert when suspicious activity is detected
- Track and recognize individuals as they move across the camera network, i.e. different cameras in real-time.


## üíªUsage
* The Web based interface comes with a three-tiered authentication for Ministry Of Defence, Intelligence Agencies and Border Security Forse (BSF) :
    * **Ministry Of Defence** : Has access to Data Analytics Dashboard, Alerts and Real-time chat.
    * **Intelligence Agencies** : Has access to Data Analytics Dashboard, Alerts and Real-time chat along with access to all CCTV feeds.
    * **Border Security Force** : Can create daily reports and monitor the CCTV feeds assigned to their territory.
* The Dashboard showcases the count of potentially concerning events detected across multiple CCTV feeds under scrutiny.
* Chat rooms to facilitate real time communication between intelligence agencies and ministry of defence using **Socket.IO**.
* **Re-identification** of the suspect inspite of occlusion in different CCTV feeds is performed using **YOLOv8** model for object detection & tracking. **ResNet50** pretrained model is used for feature extraction and extracted features of different video frames are compared using Cosine similarity which helps in re-identifying the suspect successfully.
* **Detection of Suspicious Activities** is achieved through a **LRCN=CNN+LSTM** based DeepLearning Model. LRCN is a neural network architecture that combines CNNs with LSTM networks.  This model tracks many human-activities like walking, running, boxing, fighting, handwaving, etc.

## üöÄ Flow of Events
**1)** Live inputs from the cameras will be fed via Web Interface into the object tracking and re-ID system which will further keep humans into the frame.\
 **2)** After successfully having a person in a frame, the suspicious activity detection system comes into the picture which classifies the performed activity into one of those for which the model is trained.\
 **3)** All this real-time data is then stored into a secured database which contains all the necessary details like camera location, date & time, detected activity, accuracy, and the count of a particular activity.\
**4)** The BSF will retrieve the stored data to generate a report, and if necessary, the chat system can be utilized by the Ministry of Defence and Intelligence Agents for communication.
